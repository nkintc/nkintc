# Chris Nkinthorn-@[nkintc](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless)

:wave: Hello! This is my Github profile! I'm a student earning an MS in Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI); BS from Trinity Univeristy in the same subject. This Github holds the source files for [brainless](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/brainless), where I keep my knowledge; nkintc, the gitbook associated with my notes; and [folderMath](https://nkintc.gitbook.io/foldermath/) where I am currently writing a survey of the mathematics which describe origami.
